# Port Scanner

A simple Python-based **TCP port scanner** that checks for open ports on a specified IP address or hostname.  
This tool is built using only Python’s built-in libraries, making it lightweight and easy to understand for anyone learning network programming or ethical hacking.

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

I built this project as a hands-on way to:
- Learn how **network sockets** work in Python
- Understand the fundamentals of **TCP communication**
- Explore how port scanning tools like Nmap operate under the hood
- Practice building a real-world tool using **basic programming constructs**

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use Python’s `socket` module to create TCP connections
- How to implement **port scanning** logic
- How to calculate and display **execution time**
- Why scanning responsibly and legally is critical in cybersecurity

---

## 🚀 Features

- Scans a specified range of **TCP ports**
- Detects and prints all **open ports**
- Displays **total time taken** in seconds and in minutes + seconds
- Uses a **simple and readable structure** with no external dependencies

---

## 📌 Why This Project Is Useful

- Helps new developers understand how **networks and ports** work
- Serves as a lightweight alternative to more complex tools like Nmap

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No third-party libraries required

---
